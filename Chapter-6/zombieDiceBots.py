# Create 3 different dices - green, yellow and red:
# Green has more brains than shotguns
# Red has more shotguns than brains
# Yellow has even brains and shotguns
# It is a multiplayer game where one draws 3 dices from a cup of 13 dices
# Roll those 3 dices
# Count the brains and shotguns:
# If there are 3 shotguns the players turn ended and no points added
# If shotguns are between 0-2, the player choose to collect the brains and continue
# Or collect the brains and pass
# If they continue they need to draw three more dices
# The turn is over when all 13 dices have been rolled or 3 shotguns have been collected
# If 13 brains are reached the game stops and the winner is the one with most brains collected.
# Other players have one more run to go.
# If it is a tie, the two players one more roll of 3 dices.
